Changes from official version

Tools
   - Add -v/--verbose flag to eco command
   - Add ecosxterm shell command to start a new OSX terminal with specified environments
      It accepts the same flag as standard eco command
   - bash environment setup support:
      The ECO_SHELL environement variable can be set to 'bash' or 'csh' (default) to
      control the output of eco command

Environment
   - Add special tokens '@path', '@tool' and '@version'.
      Those are replaced respectively by the .env file fullpath, the current tool name and version.
   - Support for flexible requirements based on 'Semantic Versioning 2.0.0'
      (http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
   - Allow simultaneous usage of 'strict' and 'abs' in environment keys
   - Add new 'prepend' boolean option to environment keys
   - Add new 'if_exists' boolean option. When true, values are meeged into the environment
      only if the variable already exists rather than creating a new one
   - Add new 'if_matches' dict option. Key are variable names and values are regular expressions
      that will be run against their respective keys environment variable expanded value.
      If there's no match, values won't be appended to the environment. All expressions must match
      for the values to be appended
   - Allow usage of python eval in key values:
      Example: "HOUDINI_MAJOR_RELEASE": eval('"@version".split(".")[0]'),
   - Support , separated notation in optionals (and logic)
   - Less picky about missing keys at environment top level (only 'tool' and 'platforms' are mandatory)
   - Allow usage of '/' to separate tool name from version in requirements
      (usefull for libraries whose names end with a number like xml2, hdf5)
